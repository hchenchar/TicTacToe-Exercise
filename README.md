# TicTacToe-Exercise
Description of Project: This project manages state across parent and child components and also works through the component lifecycle by mounting (creating) components on the DOM, updating them, and unmounting(deleting) them from the DOM so that they're no longer displayed.

How to Run: Clone this repository to your local machine, then open a command line on your computer terminal and run the command "cd path-to-project-root (the directory where the cloned repository is located on your local machine). From there, run "npm install http-server" and once complete, run "http-server -c-1". Lastly, open your web browser and load: http://127.0.0.1:8080. Once the TicTacToe page loads, you can selection an action to continue and proceed to interact with the Board.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: Looking ahead, I would like to add in a move history list to display the previous moves of the player.
